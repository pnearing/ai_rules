# How We Research Project Context

## Purpose
Establish a systematic approach to analyze and understand project structure, components, and relationships.

## Trigger Conditions
- Starting work on a new project
- Resuming work after context switch
- Analyzing specific project components
- Understanding project architecture
- Investigating dependencies

## Requirements
1. Project Access
   - Source code available
   - Configuration files accessible
   - Documentation present
   - Work files identified

2. Analysis Scope
   - Project boundaries defined
   - Focus areas identified
   - Component relationships clear
   - Dependencies documented

3. Documentation Requirements
   - Findings documented
   - Gaps identified
   - Questions listed
   - Understanding verified

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize Project Review
   - Access project repository
   - Check source code structure
   - Review configuration files
   - Examine documentation
   - List work files

2. Analyze Project Components
   - Identify main components
   - Map project structure
   - Document relationships
   - Note dependencies
   - List key features

3. Document Understanding
   - Summarize architecture
   - List key components
   - Map dependencies
   - Note technical constraints
   - Identify gaps

4. Verify Comprehension
   - Check architectural understanding
   - Verify component relationships
   - Validate technical constraints
   - List open questions
   - Request clarification

5. Present Findings
   - Share project overview
   - Highlight key features
   - Document structure
   - Note gaps
   - Get confirmation

## Examples
### Good Example
```markdown
# Project Analysis: Authentication Service

## Structure
- src/
  - auth/
    - controllers/
    - services/
    - models/
  - config/
  - tests/

## Components
1. Authentication Controller
   - Handles user authentication
   - Manages sessions
   - Rate limiting implemented

2. Database Integration
   - PostgreSQL for user data
   - Redis for caching
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Questions
1. Rate limiting configuration?
2. Session duration policy?

[Clear structure, identified components, specific questions]
```

### Bad Example
```markdown
# Project Review

Looked at the code. Seems to be about users and auth stuff.
Has some database things. Not sure about the details.
Maybe need to check more?

[Vague, incomplete, no structure]
```
