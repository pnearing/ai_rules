  "application": "This rule SHOULD be applied whenever an agent receives new data, enabling the system to adapt and respond to changing environments and requirements.",
  "importance": "This rule matters as it enhances the overall efficiency of agent interactions and decision-making processes, leading to improved system performance and responsiveness."
}

## memory_update_procedures

  "requirements": [
    "MUST validate new information before updating memory to prevent erroneous data integration.",
    "MUST log all changes made to agent memory for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.",

            return value
        logging.warning(f'Key {key} not found in memory')
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    agent = Agent('Agent007')
    agent.update_memory('location', 'Room A')  # Valid update

```

This example demonstrates the 'agent-memory' rule by implementing a simple Agent class that manages its own memory in a multi-agent system. The key components include:

1. **Memory Update Procedures**: The `update_memory` method is responsible for updating the agent's memory when new information is received. It validates the new data through the `validate_data` method to ensure that only valid information is stored. This prevents erroneous data from compromising the agent's decision-making process.

2. **Logging**: Changes to the agent's memory are logged using Python's logging module, allowing for effective auditing and troubleshooting. Each time memory is updated, the old and new values are recorded, providing transparency in memory management.

3. **Notification to Other Agents**: Upon successful memory update, the agent notifies other agents of the change through the `notify_agents` method. This promotes synchronization among agents and ensures that they all have access to the latest data, enhancing collaborative decision-making.

4. **Memory Retrieval Guidelines**: The `retrieve_memory` method allows agents to access their stored information. It also includes a placeholder for a freshness check, ensuring that stale or outdated information is not returned. Logging provides feedback about successful or failed retrieval attempts.

5. **Error Handling**: The example includes error handling for invalid data updates, logging an error message when the data does not pass validation. This ensures that agents can gracefully handle unexpected input without crashing.

6. **Best Practices**: Overall, the example adopts best practices by clearly organizing methods, providing appropriate comments, and implementing logging and validation mechanisms, which are crucial for maintaining reliability and efficiency in multi-agent systems.

  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER allow agents to update their memory with unvalidated information, as this can compromise decision-making integrity.",
    "NEVER omit logging when changes are made to agent memory; failing to log can hinder troubleshooting and auditing efforts.",
    "NEVER ignore notifications to relevant agents after a memory update, as this can lead to synchronization issues.",
    "NEVER return outdated or stale information from memory; a freshness check MUST be performed before any retrieval.",
    "NEVER permit memory overflows; a limit on memory usage MUST be enforced to maintain system performance."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Failing to validate memory updates can result in incorrect data being stored, leading to poor decision-making and potential system failures.",
    "Without logging memory changes, it becomes difficult to trace back issues, making debugging and system audits virtually impossible.",
    "Ignoring notifications to other agents can lead to discrepancies in agent states, resulting in miscommunication and ineffective collaboration.",
    "Returning stale information can cause agents to act on outdated data, potentially resulting in wrong actions or decisions being made based on incorrect context.",
    "Allowing memory overflows can cause performance degradation, leading to slow response times or crashes, ultimately affecting the entire multi-agent system."
